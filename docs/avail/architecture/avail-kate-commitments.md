## Secure mathematical primitives


## What are Kate Commitments?


## What are the benefits of using Kate Commitments?

Kate commitments allows a node to commit to values in a succinct manner 
to be kept inside the block header. Short openings are possible which helps 
a light client verify availability. The cryptographic binding property helps 
us avoid fraud proofs by making it computationally infeasible to produce wrong 
commitments.
